This app consists of a list of technologies, on which you can click to see a description of the technology. It uses animation to make the user interface more fun!

This **cross-platform** mobile application is written completely in [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), and could be run in both IOS and Android. This app also uses [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/) to manage its state.

To run the app make sure you:

1. Clone the project it in a local repository.
1. If you never ran a React-Native project you need to do some [setup](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) on your device.
1. Run the project by navigating to the project directory from the command line and typing:
    * `react-native run-ios` for IOS
    * `react-native run-android` for Android
